Translates 2-letter country ISO code to country name.

This database consists of one table which allows for translation of
2-letter country ISO code to country name in English (en_GB) and Chinese
(zh_CN, zh_TW) languages, coordinates (lat, lon).

This database is based in part on Per Gustafsson's ip2nation
(ip2nation.com). This table is fully compatible with the ip2nation
database.
